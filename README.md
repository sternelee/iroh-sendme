# Sendme

This is an example application using [iroh](https://crates.io/crates/iroh) with
the [iroh-blobs](https://crates.io/crates/iroh-blobs) protocol to send files and
directories over the internet.

It is also useful as a standalone tool for quick copy jobs.

Iroh will take care of hole punching and NAT traversal whenever possible,
and fall back to a relay if hole punching does not succeed.

Iroh-blobs will take care of [blake3](https://crates.io/crates/blake3) verified
streaming, including resuming interrupted downloads.

Sendme works with 256 bit node ids and is, therefore, location transparent. A ticket
will remain valid if the IP address changes. Connections are encrypted using
TLS.
